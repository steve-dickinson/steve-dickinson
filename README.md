## 👨‍💻 About Me

I specialise in delivering practical, high-quality AI solutions that solve real problems across Defra and wider government. I focus on building responsible, transparent systems, modernising legacy environments, and introducing new ways of working that help engineering teams move faster with confidence.

A core part of my work is **enabling teams to use AI tooling effectively** — from hands-on experimentation to operational rollout — reducing barriers and helping engineers build, evaluate, and adopt AI safely. I bring clarity to emerging tools, establish patterns for responsible use, and support teams as they learn, deliver, and evolve.

I work across government to share patterns, frameworks, and learning so we don't reinvent the wheel — enabling teams to adopt AI safely while reducing duplication and increasing impact. Whether designing RAG architectures, shaping platforms, enabling AI agents, or breaking through technical constraints, I deliver solutions that work and help others do the same.

## 🧠 AI Agents & Orchestration

I’m actively exploring and enabling teams to use **AI agents** for real workflows — moving beyond simple prompts to multi-step, tool-driven automation. My focus areas include:

- agent tool-use (search, retrieval, analysis, transformation)  
- multi-step planning and orchestration  
- grounding agents through RAG + structured data  
- evaluating agent behaviour and reliability  
- enabling developers to build and test agent workflows  
- supporting agents as part of legacy modernisation and automation  

The goal is to make agentic systems **practical, safe, and production-ready** for government services.

---

## 🚀 Highlights & Focus Areas

- **Responsible AI Delivery** — Transparent, secure and explainable systems for government use.  
- **RAG & LLM Integration** — Domain-specific assistants, retrieval pipelines, production-ready architectures.  
- **AI Agents & Tooling** — Multi-step automated workflows, tool-based reasoning, safe experimentation.  
- **AI Tooling Enablement** — Supporting teams to adopt AI coding assistants, evaluation tools and frameworks.  
- **Legacy Modernisation** — Reducing complexity, improving reliability, enabling future capability.  
- **Cross-Government Reuse** — Sharing learning, patterns and frameworks to prevent reinvention.  
- **Engineering Leadership** — Enabling fast flow, reducing friction, clearing blockers.
